<h2>Function to prioritise genes given a list of genomic regions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xPierGRs</code> is supposed to prioritise genes given a list of genomic
regions with or without the significance level. To prioritise genes, it
first defines and scores genes crosslinking to an input list of genomic
regions (GR). With seed genes and their scores, it then uses Random
Walk with Restart (RWR) to calculate the affinity score of all nodes in
the input graph to the seed genes. The priority score is the affinity
score. Parallel computing is also supported for Linux-like or Windows
operating systems. It returns an object of class &quot;pNode&quot;.
</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named input vector containing the significance level for
genomic regions (GR). For this named vector, the element names are GR,
in the format of 'chrN:start-end', where N is either 1-22 or X, start
(or end) is genomic positional number; for example, 'chr1:13-20', the
element values for the significance level (measured as p-value or fdr).
Alternatively, it can be a matrix or data frame with two columns: 1st
column for GR, 2nd column for the significance level. Also supported is
the input with GR only (without the significance level)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>significance.threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on the
significance level when transforming the significance level of GR into
scores. If given, those GR below this are considered significant and
thus scored positively. Instead, those above this are considered
insignificant and thus receive no score</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>score.cap</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum score being capped. By default, it is set
to NULL, meaning that no capping is applied</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>build.conversion</code></td>
<td>
<p>the conversion from one genome build to
another. The conversions supported are &quot;hg38.to.hg19&quot; and
&quot;hg18.to.hg19&quot;. By default it is NA (no need to do so)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>crosslink</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in crosslink info with a score quantifying
the link of a GR to a gene. See <code>xGR2xGenes</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>crosslink.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>the crosslink info with a score quantifying
the link of a GR to a gene. A user-input matrix or data frame with 4
columns: 1st column for genomic regions (formatted as &quot;chr:start-end&quot;,
genome build 19), 2nd column for Genes, 3rd for crosslink score
(crosslinking a genomic region to a gene, such as -log10 significance
level), and 4th for contexts (optional; if nor provided, it will be
added as 'C'). Alternatively, it can be a file containing these 4
columns. Required, otherwise it will return NULL</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cdf.function</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying how to transform the input
crosslink score. It can be one of 'original' (no such transformation),
and 'empirical' for looking at empirical Cumulative Distribution
Function (cdf; as such it is converted into pvalue-like values [0,1])</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scoring.scheme</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method used to calculate seed gene scores
under a set of GR (also over Contexts if many). It can be one of &quot;sum&quot;
for adding up, &quot;max&quot; for the maximum, and &quot;sequential&quot; for the
sequential weighting. The sequential weighting is done via:
<i>&sum;_{i=1}{\frac{R_{i}}{i}}</i>, where <i>R_{i}</i> is the
<i>i^{th}</i> rank (in a descreasing order)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nearby.distance.max</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum distance between genes and GR.
Only those genes no far way from this distance will be considered as
seed genes. This parameter will influence the distance-component
weights calculated for nearby GR per gene</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nearby.decay.kernel</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying a decay kernel
function. It can be one of 'slow' for slow decay, 'linear' for linear
decay, and 'rapid' for rapid decay. If no distance weight is used,
please select 'constant'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nearby.decay.exponent</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric specifying a decay exponent. By
default, it sets to 2</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in network. Currently two sources of network
information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the
Pathway Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of
undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways
Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the
physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of
interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of
the interactions. In STRING, &quot;STRING_highest&quot; indicates interactions
with highest confidence (confidence scores&gt;=900), &quot;STRING_high&quot; for
interactions with high confidence (confidence scores&gt;=700),
&quot;STRING_medium&quot; for interactions with medium confidence (confidence
scores&gt;=400), and &quot;STRING_low&quot; for interactions with low confidence
(confidence scores&gt;=150). For undirect/physical interactions from
Pathways Commons, &quot;PCommonsUN_high&quot; indicates undirect interactions
with high confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at
least 2 different sources), &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for undirect
interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed
references). For direct (pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways
Commons, &quot;PCommonsDN_high&quot; indicates direct interactions with high
confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2
different sources), and &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for direct interactions
with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). In
addition to pooled version of pathways from all data sources, the user
can also choose the pathway-merged network from individual sources,
that is, &quot;PCommonsDN_Reactome&quot; for those from Reactome,
&quot;PCommonsDN_KEGG&quot; for those from KEGG, &quot;PCommonsDN_HumanCyc&quot; for those
from HumanCyc, &quot;PCommonsDN_PID&quot; for those froom PID,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PANTHER&quot; for those from PANTHER, &quot;PCommonsDN_ReconX&quot; for
those from ReconX, &quot;PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC&quot; for those from TRANSFAC,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite&quot; for those from PhosphoSite, and
&quot;PCommonsDN_CTD&quot; for those from CTD. For direct (pathway-merged)
interactions sourced from KEGG, it can be 'KEGG' for all,
'KEGG_metabolism' for pathways grouped into 'Metabolism',
'KEGG_genetic' for 'Genetic Information Processing' pathways,
'KEGG_environmental' for 'Environmental Information Processing'
pathways, 'KEGG_cellular' for 'Cellular Processes' pathways,
'KEGG_organismal' for 'Organismal Systems' pathways, and 'KEGG_disease'
for 'Human Diseases' pathways. 'REACTOME' for protein-protein
interactions derived from Reactome pathways</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>STRING.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>the further restriction of STRING by interaction
type. If NA, no such restriction. Otherwide, it can be one or more of
&quot;neighborhood_score&quot;,&quot;fusion_score&quot;,&quot;cooccurence_score&quot;,&quot;coexpression_score&quot;,&quot;experimental_score&quot;,&quot;database_score&quot;,&quot;textmining_score&quot;.
Useful options are c(&quot;experimental_score&quot;,&quot;database_score&quot;): only
experimental data (extracted from BIND, DIP, GRID, HPRD, IntAct, MINT,
and PID) and curated data (extracted from Biocarta, BioCyc, GO, KEGG,
and Reactome) are used</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weighted</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether edge weights should be
considered. By default, it sets to false. If true, it only works for
the network from the STRING database</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. By default, it
is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised
network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This
customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in
network. If the user provides the &quot;igraph&quot; object with the &quot;weight&quot;
edge attribute, RWR will assume to walk on the weighted network</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seeds.inclusive</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether non-network seed
genes are included for prioritisation. If TRUE (by default), these
genes will be added to the netowrk</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>normalise</code></td>
<td>
<p>the way to normalise the adjacency matrix of the input
graph. It can be 'laplacian' for laplacian normalisation, 'row' for
row-wise normalisation, 'column' for column-wise normalisation, or
'none'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>restart</code></td>
<td>
<p>the restart probability used for Random Walk with
Restart (RWR). The restart probability takes the value from 0 to 1,
controlling the range from the starting nodes/seeds that the walker
will explore. The higher the value, the more likely the walker is to
visit the nodes centered on the starting nodes. At the extreme when the
restart probability is zero, the walker moves freely to the neighbors
at each step without restarting from seeds, i.e., following a random
walk (RW)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>normalise.affinity.matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>the way to normalise the output
affinity matrix. It can be 'none' for no normalisation, 'quantile' for
quantile normalisation to ensure that columns (if multiple) of the
output affinity matrix have the same quantiles</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether parallel computation with
multicores is used. By default, it sets to true, but not necessarily
does so. Partly because parallel backends available will be
system-specific (now only Linux or Mac OS). Also, it will depend on
whether these two packages &quot;foreach&quot; and &quot;doMC&quot; have been installed</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multicores</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer to specify how many cores will be
registered as the multicore parallel backend to the 'foreach' package.
If NULL, it will use a half of cores available in a user's computer.
This option only works when parallel computation is enabled</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RData.location</code></td>
<td>
<p>the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>guid</code></td>
<td>
<p>a valid (5-character) Global Unique IDentifier for an OSF
project. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>
