<h2>Function to extract priority matrix from a list of pNode objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xPierMatrix</code> is supposed to extract priority matrix from a list
of pNode objects. Also supported is the aggregation of priority matrix
(similar to the meta-analysis) generating the priority results; we view
this functionality as the discovery mode of the prioritisation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
xPierMatrix(list_pNode, displayBy = c("score", "rank", "weight",
"pvalue"),
combineBy = c("intersect", "union"), aggregateBy = c("none", "fishers",
"logistic", "Ztransform", "orderStatistic"), verbose = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>list_pNode</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of &quot;pNode&quot; objects or a &quot;pNode&quot; object</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>displayBy</code></td>
<td>
<p>which priority will be extracted. It can be &quot;score&quot;
for priority score (by default), &quot;rank&quot; for priority rank, &quot;weight&quot; for
seed weight, &quot;pvalue&quot; for priority p-value</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>combineBy</code></td>
<td>
<p>how to resolve nodes/targets from a list of &quot;pNode&quot;
objects. It can be &quot;intersect&quot; for intersecting nodes (by default),
&quot;union&quot; for unionising nodes</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>aggregateBy</code></td>
<td>
<p>the aggregate method used. It can be either &quot;none&quot;
for no aggregation, or &quot;orderStatistic&quot; for the method based on the
order statistics of p-values, &quot;fishers&quot; for Fisher's method,
&quot;Ztransform&quot; for Z-transform method, &quot;logistic&quot; for the logistic
method. Without loss of generality, the Z-transform method does well in
problems where evidence against the combined null is spread widely
(equal footings) or when the total evidence is weak; Fisher's method
does best in problems where the evidence is concentrated in a
relatively small fraction of the individual tests or when the evidence
is at least moderately strong; the logistic method provides a
compromise between these two. Notably, the aggregate methods 'fishers'
and 'logistic' are preferred here</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If aggregateBy is 'none' (by default), a data frame containing priority
matrix, with each column/predictor for either priority score, or
priorty rank or priority p-value.
If aggregateBy is not 'none', an object of the class &quot;dTarget&quot;, a list
with following components:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>priority</code>: a data frame of nGene X 5 containing gene
priority (aggregated) information, where nGene is the number of genes,
and the 5 columns are &quot;name&quot; (gene names), &quot;rank&quot; (ranks of the
priority scores), &quot;pvalue&quot; (the aggregated p-value, converted from
empirical cumulative distribution of the probability of being GSP),
&quot;fdr&quot; (fdr adjusted from the aggregated p-value), &quot;priority&quot;
(-log10(pvalue) but rescaled into the 0-10 range)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>predictor</code>: a data frame containing priority matrix, with
each column/predictor for either priority score, or priorty rank or
priority p-value
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>call</code>: the call that produced this result
</p>
</li></ul>
