<h2>Function to prepare genetic predictors given GWAS summary data with eGenes identified through ABF</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xPierSNPsAdvABF</code> is supposed to prepare genetic predictors given
GWAS summary data with eGenes identified through ABF. Internally it
calls <code>xPierSNPs</code> to prepare the distance predictor and the
HiC predictors (if required), and <code>xPierABF</code> to prepare the
eQTL predictors (if required). It returns a list of class &quot;pNode&quot;
objects.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame storing GWAS summary data with following
required columns 'snp', 'p' (p-value), 'effect' (the effect allele
assessed), 'other' (other allele), 'b' (effect size for the allele
assessed; log(odds ratio) for a case-control study), 'se' (standard
error), 'suggestive' (logical, and those false only to define
nGene/cGene; all used to define eGene)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>include.LD</code></td>
<td>
<p>additional SNPs in LD with Lead SNPs are also
included. By default, it is 'NA' to disable this option. Otherwise, LD
SNPs will be included based on one or more of 5 super-populations from
1000 Genomics Project data (phase 3). They are &quot;AFR&quot;, &quot;AMR&quot;, &quot;EAS&quot;,
&quot;EUR&quot;, and &quot;SAS&quot;. Explanations for population code can be found at
<a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/which-populations-are-part-your-study">http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/which-populations-are-part-your-study</a></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>LD.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>a user-input matrix or data frame with 3 columns:
1st column for Lead SNPs, 2nd column for LD SNPs, and 3rd for LD r2
value. It is designed to allow the user analysing their pre-calculated
LD info. This customisation (if provided) has the high priority over
built-in LD SNPs</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>LD.r2</code></td>
<td>
<p>the LD r2 value. By default, it is 0.8, meaning that SNPs
in LD (r2&gt;=0.8) with input SNPs will be considered as LD SNPs. It can
be any value from 0.8 to 1</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>significance.threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on the
significance level when transforming the significance level of SNPs
into scores. If given, those SNPs below this are considered significant
and thus scored positively. Instead, those above this are considered
insigificant and thus receive no score</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>score.cap</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum score being capped. By default, it is set
to 10. If NULL, no capping is applied</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>distance.max</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum distance between genes and SNPs. Only
those genes no far way from this distance will be considered as seed
genes. This parameter will influence the distance-component weights
calculated for nearby SNPs per gene</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>decay.kernel</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying a decay kernel function. It
can be one of 'slow' for slow decay, 'linear' for linear decay, and
'rapid' for rapid decay. If no distance weight is used, please select
'constant'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>decay.exponent</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer specifying a decay exponent. By
default, it sets to 2</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>GR.SNP</code></td>
<td>
<p>the genomic regions of SNPs. By default, it is
'dbSNP_GWAS', that is, SNPs from dbSNP (version 146) restricted to GWAS
SNPs and their LD SNPs (hg19). It can be 'dbSNP_Common', that is,
Common SNPs from dbSNP (version 146) plus GWAS SNPs and their LD SNPs
(hg19). Alternatively, the user can specify the customised input. To do
so, first save your RData file (containing an GR object) into your
local computer, and make sure the GR object content names refer to
dbSNP IDs. Then, tell &quot;GR.SNP&quot; with your RData file name (with or
without extension), plus specify your file RData path in
&quot;RData.location&quot;. Note: you can also load your customised GR object
directly</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>GR.Gene</code></td>
<td>
<p>the genomic regions of genes. By default, it is
'UCSC_knownGene', that is, UCSC known genes (together with genomic
locations) based on human genome assembly hg19. It can be
'UCSC_knownCanonical', that is, UCSC known canonical genes (together
with genomic locations) based on human genome assembly hg19.
Alternatively, the user can specify the customised input. To do so,
first save your RData file (containing an GR object) into your local
computer, and make sure the GR object content names refer to Gene
Symbols. Then, tell &quot;GR.Gene&quot; with your RData file name (with or
without extension), plus specify your file RData path in
&quot;RData.location&quot;. Note: you can also load your customised GR object
directly</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>include.TAD</code></td>
<td>
<p>TAD boundary regions are also included. By default,
it is 'none' to disable this option. Otherwise, inclusion of a TAD
dataset to pre-filter SNP-nGene pairs (i.e. only those within a TAD
region will be kept). TAD datasets can be one of &quot;GM12878&quot;
(lymphoblast), &quot;IMR90&quot; (fibroblast), &quot;MSC&quot; (mesenchymal stem cell)
,&quot;TRO&quot; (trophoblasts-like cell), &quot;H1&quot; (embryonic stem cell), &quot;MES&quot;
(mesendoderm) and &quot;NPC&quot; (neural progenitor cell). Explanations can be
found at <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.061">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.061</a></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>include.eQTL</code></td>
<td>
<p>the context-specific eQTL summary data supported

<tr valign="top"><td><code>include.HiC</code></td>
<td>
<p>genes linked to input SNPs are also included. By
default, it is 'NA' to disable this option. Otherwise, those genes
linked to SNPs will be included according to Promoter Capture HiC
(PCHiC) datasets. Pre-built HiC datasets are detailed in
<code>xDefineHIC</code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cdf.function</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying a Cumulative Distribution
Function (cdf). It can be one of 'exponential' based on exponential
cdf, 'empirical' for empirical cdf</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scoring.scheme</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method used to calculate seed gene scores
under a set of SNPs. It can be one of &quot;sum&quot; for adding up, &quot;max&quot; for
the maximum, and &quot;sequential&quot; for the sequential weighting. The
sequential weighting is done via: <i>&sum;_{i=1}{\frac{R_{i}}{i}}</i>,
where <i>R_{i}</i> is the <i>i^{th}</i> rank (in a descreasing order)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in network. Currently two sources of network
information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the
Pathway Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of
undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways
Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the
physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of
interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of
the interactions. In STRING, &quot;STRING_highest&quot; indicates interactions
with highest confidence (confidence scores&gt;=900), &quot;STRING_high&quot; for
interactions with high confidence (confidence scores&gt;=700),
&quot;STRING_medium&quot; for interactions with medium confidence (confidence
scores&gt;=400), and &quot;STRING_low&quot; for interactions with low confidence
(confidence scores&gt;=150). For undirect/physical interactions from
Pathways Commons, &quot;PCommonsUN_high&quot; indicates undirect interactions
with high confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at
least 2 different sources), &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for undirect
interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed
references). For direct (pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways
Commons, &quot;PCommonsDN_high&quot; indicates direct interactions with high
confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2
different sources), and &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for direct interactions
with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). In
addition to pooled version of pathways from all data sources, the user
can also choose the pathway-merged network from individual sources,
that is, &quot;PCommonsDN_Reactome&quot; for those from Reactome,
&quot;PCommonsDN_KEGG&quot; for those from KEGG, &quot;PCommonsDN_HumanCyc&quot; for those
from HumanCyc, &quot;PCommonsDN_PID&quot; for those froom PID,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PANTHER&quot; for those from PANTHER, &quot;PCommonsDN_ReconX&quot; for
those from ReconX, &quot;PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC&quot; for those from TRANSFAC,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite&quot; for those from PhosphoSite, and
&quot;PCommonsDN_CTD&quot; for those from CTD. For direct (pathway-merged)
interactions sourced from KEGG, it can be 'KEGG' for all,
'KEGG_metabolism' for pathways grouped into 'Metabolism',
'KEGG_genetic' for 'Genetic Information Processing' pathways,
'KEGG_environmental' for 'Environmental Information Processing'
pathways, 'KEGG_cellular' for 'Cellular Processes' pathways,
'KEGG_organismal' for 'Organismal Systems' pathways, and 'KEGG_disease'
for 'Human Diseases' pathways. 'REACTOME' for protein-protein
interactions derived from Reactome pathways</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>STRING.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>the further restriction of STRING by interaction
type. If NA, no such restriction. Otherwide, it can be one or more of
&quot;neighborhood_score&quot;,&quot;fusion_score&quot;,&quot;cooccurence_score&quot;,&quot;coexpression_score&quot;,&quot;experimental_score&quot;,&quot;database_score&quot;,&quot;textmining_score&quot;.
Useful options are c(&quot;experimental_score&quot;,&quot;database_score&quot;): only
experimental data (extracted from BIND, DIP, GRID, HPRD, IntAct, MINT,
and PID) and curated data (extracted from Biocarta, BioCyc, GO, KEGG,
and Reactome) are used</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weighted</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether edge weights should be
considered. By default, it sets to false. If true, it only works for
the network from the STRING database</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. By default, it
is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised
network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This
customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in
network. If the user provides the &quot;igraph&quot; object with the &quot;weight&quot;
edge attribute, RWR will assume to walk on the weighted network</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seeds.inclusive</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether non-network seed
genes are included for prioritisation. If TRUE (by default), these
genes will be added to the netowrk</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>normalise</code></td>
<td>
<p>the way to normalise the adjacency matrix of the input
graph. It can be 'laplacian' for laplacian normalisation, 'row' for
row-wise normalisation, 'column' for column-wise normalisation, or
'none'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>restart</code></td>
<td>
<p>the restart probability used for Random Walk with
Restart (RWR). The restart probability takes the value from 0 to 1,
controlling the range from the starting nodes/seeds that the walker
will explore. The higher the value, the more likely the walker is to
visit the nodes centered on the starting nodes. At the extreme when the
restart probability is zero, the walker moves freely to the neighbors
at each step without restarting from seeds, i.e., following a random
walk (RW)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>normalise.affinity.matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>the way to normalise the output
affinity matrix. It can be 'none' for no normalisation, 'quantile' for
quantile normalisation to ensure that columns (if multiple) of the
output affinity matrix have the same quantiles</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether parallel computation with
multicores is used. By default, it sets to true, but not necessarily
does so. Partly because parallel backends available will be
system-specific (now only Linux or Mac OS). Also, it will depend on
whether these two packages &quot;foreach&quot; and &quot;doMC&quot; have been installed</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multicores</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer to specify how many cores will be
registered as the multicore parallel backend to the 'foreach' package.
If NULL, it will use a half of cores available in a user's computer.
This option only works when parallel computation is enabled</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose.details</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the detailed
messages from being-called functions will be displayed in the screen.
By default, it sets to FALSE enabling messages</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RData.location</code></td>
<td>
<p>the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>

<td>
<p>additional parameters used in xPierABF (&quot;prior.eqtl&quot;,
