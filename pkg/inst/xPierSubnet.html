<h2>Function to identify a gene network from top prioritised genes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xPierSubnet</code> is supposed to identify maximum-scoring gene
subnetwork from a graph with the node information on priority scores,
both are part of an object of class &quot;pNode&quot;. It returns an object of
class &quot;igraph&quot;.
</p>

<pre>
xPierSubnet(pNode, priority.quantile = 0.1, network = c(NA,
"STRING_highest", "STRING_high", "STRING_medium", "STRING_low",

"KEGG_environmental", "KEGG_cellular", "KEGG_organismal",
"KEGG_disease",
"REACTOME"), STRING.only = c(NA, "neighborhood_score", "fusion_score",
"cooccurence_score", "coexpression_score", "experimental_score",
"database_score", "textmining_score")[1], network.customised = NULL,
subnet.significance = 0.01, subnet.size = NULL, test.permutation = F,

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pNode</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;pNode&quot; (or &quot;sTarget&quot; or &quot;dTarget&quot;)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>priority.quantile</code></td>
<td>
<p>the quantile of the top priority genes. By
default, 10
analysis. If NULL or NA, all prioritised genes will be used</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in network. Currently two sources of network
information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the
Pathway Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of
undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways
Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the
physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of
interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of
the interactions. In STRING, &quot;STRING_highest&quot; indicates interactions
with highest confidence (confidence scores&gt;=900), &quot;STRING_high&quot; for
interactions with high confidence (confidence scores&gt;=700),
&quot;STRING_medium&quot; for interactions with medium confidence (confidence
scores&gt;=400), and &quot;STRING_low&quot; for interactions with low confidence
(confidence scores&gt;=150). For undirect/physical interactions from
Pathways Commons, &quot;PCommonsUN_high&quot; indicates undirect interactions
with high confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at
least 2 different sources), &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for undirect
interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed
references). For direct (pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways
Commons, &quot;PCommonsDN_high&quot; indicates direct interactions with high
confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2
different sources), and &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for direct interactions
with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). In
addition to pooled version of pathways from all data sources, the user
can also choose the pathway-merged network from individual sources,
that is, &quot;PCommonsDN_Reactome&quot; for those from Reactome,
&quot;PCommonsDN_KEGG&quot; for those from KEGG, &quot;PCommonsDN_HumanCyc&quot; for those
from HumanCyc, &quot;PCommonsDN_PID&quot; for those froom PID,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PANTHER&quot; for those from PANTHER, &quot;PCommonsDN_ReconX&quot; for
those from ReconX, &quot;PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC&quot; for those from TRANSFAC,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite&quot; for those from PhosphoSite, and
&quot;PCommonsDN_CTD&quot; for those from CTD. For direct (pathway-merged)
interactions sourced from KEGG, it can be 'KEGG' for all,
'KEGG_metabolism' for pathways grouped into 'Metabolism',
'KEGG_genetic' for 'Genetic Information Processing' pathways,
'KEGG_environmental' for 'Environmental Information Processing'
pathways, 'KEGG_cellular' for 'Cellular Processes' pathways,
'KEGG_organismal' for 'Organismal Systems' pathways, and 'KEGG_disease'
for 'Human Diseases' pathways. 'REACTOME' for protein-protein
interactions derived from Reactome pathways</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>STRING.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>the further restriction of STRING by interaction
type. If NA, no such restriction. Otherwide, it can be one or more of
&quot;neighborhood_score&quot;,&quot;fusion_score&quot;,&quot;cooccurence_score&quot;,&quot;coexpression_score&quot;,&quot;experimental_score&quot;,&quot;database_score&quot;,&quot;textmining_score&quot;.
Useful options are c(&quot;experimental_score&quot;,&quot;database_score&quot;): only
experimental data (extracted from BIND, DIP, GRID, HPRD, IntAct, MINT,
and PID) and curated data (extracted from Biocarta, BioCyc, GO, KEGG,
and Reactome) are used</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. By default, it
is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised
network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This
customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in
network</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subnet.significance</code></td>
<td>
<p>the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on
nodes/genes. If given, those nodes/genes with p-values below this are
considered significant and thus scored positively. Instead, those
p-values above this given significance threshold are considered
insigificant and thus scored negatively</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subnet.size</code></td>
<td>
<p>the desired number of nodes constrained to the
resulting subnet. It is not nulll, a wide range of significance
thresholds will be scanned to find the optimal significance threshold
leading to the desired number of nodes in the resulting subnet.
Notably, the given significance threshold will be overwritten by this
option</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>test.permutation</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the permutation
test is perform to estimate the significance of identified network with
the same number of nodes. By default, it sets to false</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>num.permutation</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of permutations generating the null
distribution of the identified network</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>respect</code></td>
<td>
<p>how to respect nodes to be sampled. It can be one of
'none' (randomly sampling) and 'degree' (degree-preserving sampling)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>aggregateBy</code></td>
<td>
<p>the aggregate method used to aggregate edge
confidence p-values. It can be either &quot;orderStatistic&quot; for the method
based on the order statistics of p-values, or &quot;fishers&quot; for Fisher's
method, &quot;Ztransform&quot; for Z-transform method, &quot;logistic&quot; for the
logistic method. Without loss of generality, the Z-transform method
does well in problems where evidence against the combined null is
spread widely (equal footings) or when the total evidence is weak;
Fisher's method does best in problems where the evidence is
concentrated in a relatively small fraction of the individual tests or
when the evidence is at least moderately strong; the logistic method
provides a compromise between these two. Notably, the aggregate methods
'Ztransform' and 'logistic' are preferred here</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RData.location</code></td>
<td>
<p>the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a subgraph with a maximum score, an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. It has
ndoe attributes: signficance, score, type, priority (part of the
&quot;pNode&quot; object). If permutation test is enabled, it also has a graph
attribute (combinedP) and an edge attribute (edgeConfidence)
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The priority score will be first scaled to the range x=[0 100] and then
is converted to pvalue-like significant level: 10^(-x). Next,
<code>xSubneterGenes</code> is used to identify a maximum-scoring gene
subnetwork that contains as many highly prioritised genes as possible
but a few lowly prioritised genes as linkers. An iterative procedure of
scanning different priority thresholds is also used to identify the
network with a desired number of nodes/genes. Notably, the preferential
use of the same network as used in gene-level prioritisation is due to
the fact that gene-level affinity/priority scores are smoothly
distributed over the network after being walked. In other words, the
chance of identifying such a gene network enriched with top prioritised
genes is much higher.
