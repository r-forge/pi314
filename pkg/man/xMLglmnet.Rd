\usage{
xMLglmnet(
df_predictor,
GSP,
GSN,
family = c("binomial", "gaussian"),
type.measure = c("auc", "mse"),
nfold = 3,
alphas = seq(0, 1, 0.1),
standardize = TRUE,
lower.limits = -Inf,
verbose = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_predictor}{a data frame containing genes (in rows) and
predictors (in columns), with their predictive scores inside it. This
data frame must has gene symbols as row names}

\item{GSP}{a vector containing Gold Standard Positive (GSP)}

\item{GSN}{a vector containing Gold Standard Negative (GSN)}

\item{family}{response family type. It can be one of "binomial" for
two-class logistic model or "gaussian" for gaussian model}

\item{type.measure}{loss to use for cross-validation. It can be one of
"auc" for two-class logistic model, "mse" for the deviation from the
fitted mean to the response using gaussian model}

\item{nfold}{an integer specifying the number of folds for cross
validataion}

\item{alphas}{a vector specifying a range of alphas. Alpha is an
elasticnet mixing parameter, with 0<=alpha<=1. By default,
seq(0,1,by-0.1)}

\item{standardize}{logical specifying whether to standardise the
predictor. If yes (by default), the predictor standardised prior to
fitting the model. The coefficients are always returned on the original
scale}

\item{lower.limits}{vector of lower limits for each coefficient (by
default, '-Inf'; all should be non-positive). A single value provided
will apply to every coefficient}

\item{verbose}{logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to TRUE for display}

\item{RData.location}{the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See \code{\link{xRDataLoader}} for details}

\item{guid}{a valid (5-character) Global Unique IDentifier for an OSF
project. See \code{\link{xRDataLoader}} for details}

\item{...}{additional parameters. Please refer to 'glmnet::cv.glmnet'
for the complete list.}
}
\value{
an object of class "pTarget", a list with following components:
\itemize{
\item{\code{model}: an object of class "cv.glmnet" as a best model}
\item{\code{priority}: a data frame of nGene X 5 containing gene
priority information, where nGene is the number of genes in the input
data frame, and the 5 columns are "GS" (either 'GSP', or 'GSN', or
'NEW'), "name" (gene names), "rank" (ranks of the priority scores),
"priority" (priority score; rescaled into the 5-star ratings), and
"description" (gene description)}
\item{\code{predictor}: a data frame, which is the same as the input
data frame but inserting an additional column 'GS' in the first column}
\item{\code{cvm2alpha}: a data frame of nAlpha X 2 containing mean
cross-validated error, where nAlpha is the number of alpha and the two
columns are "min" (lambda.min) and "1se" (lambda.1se)}
\item{\code{nonzero2alpha}: a data frame of nAlpha X 2 containing the
number of non-zero coefficients, where nAlpha is the number of alpha
and the two columns are "min" (lambda.min) and "1se" (lambda.1se)}
\item{\code{importance}: a data frame of nPredictor X 1 containing the
predictor importance/coefficient info}
\item{\code{performance}: a data frame of 1+nPredictor X 2 containing
the supervised/predictor performance info predictor importance info,
where nPredictor is the number of predictors, two columns are "ROC"
(AUC values) and "Fmax" (F-max values)}
\item{\code{gp}: a ggplot object for the ROC curve}
\item{\code{call}: the call that produced this result}

\description{
\code{xMLglmnet} is supposed to integrate predictor matrix in a
supervised manner via machine learning algorithm glmnet. It requires
three inputs: 1) Gold Standard Positive (GSP) targets; 2) Gold Standard
Negative (GSN) targets; 3) a predictor matrix containing genes in rows
and predictors in columns, with their predictive scores inside it. It
returns an object of class 'pTarget'.
