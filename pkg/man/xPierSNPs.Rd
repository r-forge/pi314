\arguments{
\item{data}{a named input vector containing the sinificance level for
nodes (dbSNP). For this named vector, the element names are dbSNP ID
(or in the format such as 'chr16:28525386'), the element values for the
significance level (measured as p-value or fdr). Alternatively, it can
be a matrix or data frame with two columns: 1st column for dbSNP, 2nd
column for the significance level}

\item{include.LD}{additional SNPs in LD with Lead SNPs are also
included. By default, it is 'NA' to disable this option. Otherwise, LD
SNPs will be included based on one or more of 26 populations and 5
super populations from 1000 Genomics Project data (phase 3). The
population can be one of 5 super populations ("AFR", "AMR", "EAS",
"EUR", "SAS"), or one of 26 populations ("ACB", "ASW", "BEB", "CDX",
"CEU", "CHB", "CHS", "CLM", "ESN", "FIN", "GBR", "GIH", "GWD", "IBS",
"ITU", "JPT", "KHV", "LWK", "MSL", "MXL", "PEL", "PJL", "PUR", "STU",
"TSI", "YRI"). Explanations for population code can be found at
\url{http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/which-populations-are-part-your-study}}

\item{LD.customised}{a user-input matrix or data frame with 3 columns:
1st column for Lead SNPs, 2nd column for LD SNPs, and 3rd for LD r2
value. It is designed to allow the user analysing their pre-calculated
LD info. This customisation (if provided) has the high priority over
built-in LD SNPs}

\item{LD.r2}{the LD r2 value. By default, it is 0.8, meaning that SNPs
in LD (r2>=0.8) with input SNPs will be considered as LD SNPs. It can
be any value from 0.8 to 1}

\item{significance.threshold}{the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on the
significance level when transforming the significance level of SNPs
into scores. If given, those SNPs below this are considered significant
and thus scored positively. Instead, those above this are considered
insigificant and thus receive no score}

\item{distance.max}{the maximum distance between genes and SNPs. Only
those genes no far way from this distance will be considered as seed
genes. This parameter will influence the distance-component weights
calculated for nearby SNPs per gene}

\item{decay.kernel}{a character specifying a decay kernel function. It
can be one of 'slow' for slow decay, 'linear' for linear decay, and
'rapid' for rapid decay}

\item{decay.exponent}{an integer specifying a decay exponent. By
default, it sets to 2}

\item{GR.SNP}{the genomic regions of SNPs. By default, it is
'dbSNP_GWAS', that is, SNPs from dbSNP (version 146) restricted to GWAS
SNPs and their LD SNPs (hg19). It can be 'dbSNP_Common', that is,
Common SNPs from dbSNP (version 146) plus GWAS SNPs and their LD SNPs
(hg19). Alternatively, the user can specify the customised input. To do
so, first save your RData file (containing an GR object) into your
local computer, and make sure the GR object content names refer to
dbSNP IDs. Then, tell "GR.SNP" with your RData file name (with or
without extension), plus specify your file RData path in
"RData.location"}

\item{GR.Gene}{the genomic regions of genes. By default, it is
'UCSC_knownGene', that is, UCSC known genes (together with genomic
locations) based on human genome assembly hg19. It can be
'UCSC_knownCanonical', that is, UCSC known canonical genes (together
with genomic locations) based on human genome assembly hg19.
Alternatively, the user can specify the customised input. To do so,
first save your RData file (containing an GR object) into your local
computer, and make sure the GR object content names refer to Gene
Symbols. Then, tell "GR.Gene" with your RData file name (with or
without extension), plus specify your file RData path in
"RData.location"}

\item{include.eQTL}{genes modulated by eQTL (also Lead SNPs or in LD
with Lead SNPs) are also included. By default, it is 'NA' to disable
this option. Otherwise, those genes modulated by eQTL will be included:
immune stimulation in monocytes ('JKscience_TS1A' and 'JKscience_TS2B'
for cis-eQTLs or 'JKscience_TS3A' for trans-eQTLs) from Science 2014,
343(6175):1246949; cis- and trans-eQTLs in B cells ('JKng_bcell') and
in monocytes ('JKng_mono') from Nature Genetics 2012, 44(5):502-510;
cis- and trans-eQTLs in neutrophils ('JKnc_neutro') from Nature
Communications 2015, 7(6):7545; cis-eQTLs in NK cells ('JK_nk') which
is unpublished. Also supported are GTEx cis-eQTLs from Science 2015,
348(6235):648-60, including 13 tissues:
'GTEx_Adipose_Subcutaneous','GTEx_Artery_Aorta','GTEx_Artery_Tibial','GTEx_Esophagus_Mucosa','GTEx_Esophagus_Muscularis','GTEx_Heart_Left_Ventricle','GTEx_Lung','GTEx_Muscle_Skeletal','GTEx_Nerve_Tibial','GTEx_Skin_Sun_Exposed_Lower_leg','GTEx_Stomach','GTEx_Thyroid','GTEx_Whole_Blood'.}

\item{eQTL.customised}{a user-input matrix or data frame with 3
columns: 1st column for SNPs/eQTLs, 2nd column for Genes, and 3rd for
eQTL mapping significance level (p-values or FDR). It is designed to
allow the user analysing their eQTL data. This customisation (if
provided) has the high priority over built-in eQTL data.}

\item{cdf.function}{a character specifying a Cumulative Distribution
Function (cdf). It can be one of 'exponential' based on exponential
cdf, 'empirical' for empirical cdf}

\item{relative.importance}{a vector specifying the relative importance
of the distance weight and eQTL weight}

\item{scoring.scheme}{the method used to calculate seed gene scores
under a set of SNPs. It can be one of "sum" for adding up, "max" for
the maximum, and "sequential" for the sequential weighting. The
sequential weighting is done via: \eqn{\sum_{i=1}{\frac{R_{i}}{i}}},
where \eqn{R_{i}} is the \eqn{i^{th}} rank (in a descreasing order)}

\item{network}{the built-in network. Currently two sources of network
information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the
Pathways Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of
undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways
Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the
physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of
interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of
the interactions. In STRING, "STRING_highest" indicates interactions
with highest confidence (confidence scores>=900), "STRING_high" for
interactions with high confidence (confidence scores>=700), and
"STRING_medium" for interactions with medium confidence (confidence
scores>=400). For undirect/physical interactions from Pathways Commons,
"PCommonsUN_high" indicates undirect interactions with high confidence
(supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2 different
sources), "PCommonsUN_medium" for undirect interactions with medium
confidence (supported with the PubMed references). For direct
(pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways Commons, "PCommonsDN_high"
indicates direct interactions with high confidence (supported with the
PubMed references plus at least 2 different sources), and
"PCommonsUN_medium" for direct interactions with medium confidence
(supported with the PubMed references). In addtion to pooled version of
pathways from all data sources, the user can also choose the
pathway-merged network from individual sources, that is,
"PCommonsDN_Reactome" for those from Reactome, "PCommonsDN_KEGG" for
those from KEGG, "PCommonsDN_HumanCyc" for those from HumanCyc,
"PCommonsDN_PID" for those froom PID, "PCommonsDN_PANTHER" for those
from PANTHER, "PCommonsDN_ReconX" for those from ReconX,
"PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC" for those from TRANSFAC, "PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite"
for those from PhosphoSite, and "PCommonsDN_CTD" for those from CTD}

\item{weighted}{logical to indicate whether edge weights should be
considered. By default, it sets to false. If true, it only works for
the network from the STRING database}

\item{network.customised}{an object of class "igraph". By default, it
is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised
network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This
customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in
network. If the user provides the "igraph" object with the "weight"
edge attribute, RWR will assume to walk on the weighted network}

\item{normalise}{the way to normalise the adjacency matrix of the input
graph. It can be 'laplacian' for laplacian normalisation, 'row' for
row-wise normalisation, 'column' for column-wise normalisation, or
'none'}

\item{restart}{the restart probability used for Random Walk with
Restart (RWR). The restart probability takes the value from 0 to 1,
controlling the range from the starting nodes/seeds that the walker
will explore. The higher the value, the more likely the walker is to
visit the nodes centered on the starting nodes. At the extreme when the
restart probability is zero, the walker moves freely to the neighbors
at each step without restarting from seeds, i.e., following a random
walk (RW)}

\item{normalise.affinity.matrix}{the way to normalise the output
affinity matrix. It can be 'none' for no normalisation, 'quantile' for
quantile normalisation to ensure that columns (if multiple) of the
output affinity matrix have the same quantiles}

\item{parallel}{logical to indicate whether parallel computation with
multicores is used. By default, it sets to true, but not necessarily
does so. Partly because parallel backends available will be
system-specific (now only Linux or Mac OS). Also, it will depend on
whether these two packages "foreach" and "doMC" have been installed. It
can be installed via:
\code{source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R");
biocLite(c("foreach","doMC"))}. If not yet installed, this option will
be disabled}

\item{multicores}{an integer to specify how many cores will be
registered as the multicore parallel backend to the 'foreach' package.
If NULL, it will use a half of cores available in a user's computer.
This option only works when parallel computation is enabled}

\item{verbose}{logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display}

\item{RData.location}{the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See \code{\link{xRDataLoader}} for details}
}
\value{
an object of class "pNode", a list with following components:
\itemize{
\item{\code{priority}: a matrix of nNode X 4 containing node priority
information, where nNode is the number of nodes in the input graph, and
the 4 columns are "name" (node names), "seed" (1 for seeds, 0 for
non-seeds), "weight" (weight/score values for seed genes), "priority"
(the priority scores that are rescaled to the range [0,1]), "rank"
(ranks of the priority scores)}
\item{\code{g}: an input "igraph" object}
\item{\code{SNP}: a data frame of nSNP X 3 containing input SNPs and/or
LD SNPs info, where nSNP is the number of input SNPs and/or LD SNPs,
and the 3 columns are "SNP" (dbSNP), "Score" (the SNP score), "Pval"
(the SNP p-value)}
\item{\code{Gene2SNP}: a matrix of Genes X SNPs, each non-zero cell
telling an SNP's genetic influential score on a seed gene}
\item{\code{call}: the call that produced this result}
}
}
\description{
\code{xPierSNPs} is supposed to priorise genes given a list of seed
SNPs together with the significance level. To priorise genes, it first
defines and scores seed genes: nearby genes and eQTL genes. With seed
genes and their scores, it then uses Random Walk with Restart (RWR) to
calculate the affinity score of all nodes in the input graph to the
seed genes. The priority score is the affinity score. Parallel
computing is also supported for Linux or Mac operating systems. It
returns an object of class "pNode".
}
\note{
The search procedure is heuristic to find the subgraph with the maximum
score:
\itemize{
\item{i) \code{\link{xSNPscores}} used to calculate the SNP score.}
\item{ii) \code{\link{xSNP2nGenes}} used to define and score the nearby
genes.}
\item{iii) \code{\link{xSNP2eGenes}} used to define and score the eQTL
genes.}
\item{iv) define seed genes as the nearby genes in ii) and the eQTL
genes in iii), which are then scored in an integrative manner.}
\item{v) \code{\link{xPierGenes}} used to prioritise genes using an
input graph and a list of seed genes and their scores from iv). The
priority score is the affinity score estimated by Random Walk with
Restart (RWR), measured as the affinity of all nodes in the graph to
the seeds.}
