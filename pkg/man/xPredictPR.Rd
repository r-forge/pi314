\title{Function to assess the prediction performance via Precision-Recall (PR) analysis}
\usage{
xPredictPR(GSP, prediction, num.threshold = 100, bin = c("quantile",
"uniform"), recall.prediction = FALSE, plot = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{GSP}{a vector containing Glod Standard Positive (GSP)}

\item{prediction}{a data frame containing predictions along with
predictive scores. It has two columns: 1st column for target, 2nd
column for predictive scores (the higher the better)}

\item{num.threshold}{an integer to specify how many PR points (as a
function of the score threshold) will be calculated}

\item{bin}{how to bin the scores. It can be "uniform" for binning
scores with equal interval (ie with uniform distribution), and
'quantile' for binning scores with eual frequency (ie with equal
number)}

\item{recall.prediction}{logical to indicate whether the calculation of
recall is based on preditable GSP. By default, it sets to FALSE}

\item{plot}{logical to indicate whether to return an object of class
"ggplot" for plotting PR curve. By default, it sets to FALSE. If TRUE,
it will return a ggplot object after being appended with 'PR'}

\item{verbose}{logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to TRUE for display}
}
\value{
If plot is FALSE (by default), a data frame containing two columns: 1st
column 'Precision' for precision, 2nd 'Recall' for recall. The row has
the names corresponding to the score threshold.
If plot is TRUE, it will return a ggplot object after being appended
with 'PR' (a data frame containing two columns: 1st column 'Precision'
for precision, 2nd 'Recall' for recall. The row has the names
corresponding to the score threshold).
}
\description{
\code{xPredictPR} is supposed to assess the prediction performance via
Precision-Recall (PR) analysis. It requires two inputS: 1) Glod
Standard Positive (GSP) containing targets; 2) prediction containing
predicted targets and predictive scores.

\note{
F-measure: the maximum of a harmonic mean between precision and recall
along PR curve
